"Analyzing Netflix’s Global Catalog: SQL-Powered Insights on Content Type, Ratings, and Regional Trends"
Netflix Movies & TV Shows Data Analysis using SQL 🍿

Excited to share my recent data analytics project where I explored Netflix’s content library using Structured Query Language (SQL)! 💻📈

🔍 Project Overview:
I performed an in-depth analysis of Netflix’s global catalog, uncovering insights that answer key business questions such as:

🎬 Total number of shows
📺 Distribution of Movies vs TV Shows
🌍 Top contributing countries
🗓 Year-wise content trends
🎞 Popular genres like Drama
👨‍🎤 Content featuring icons like Shah Rukh Khan
👀 Keyword-based sentiment classification ("Good" vs "Bad" content)

💡 Key Insights:

India ranks among the top countries contributing content 📌

"TV-MA" is one of the most common content ratings 🧾

Certain directors, like Rajkumar Hirani, stand out with popular contributions 🎥

Using SQL, I could categorize content based on sensitive keywords such as "kill" and "violence", giving it a 'Good' or 'Bad' tag for content moderation 📚✅❌

📌 Skills Demonstrated:

Advanced SQL Queries (JOINs, Aggregations, Filtering, Categorization)

Data-driven storytelling

Business problem-solving through data

🧠 This project improved my analytical thinking and sharpened my SQL skills for real-world datasets.

🚀 Looking forward to applying these insights in larger-scale streaming data projects!
